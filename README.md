# 🚀 The Time Travel Repository 🕰️ #
Welcome to the repository that takes a fresh start...every single time!

## What does this repository do?
Every time you push to this repo, it waves its magic wand (🪄), and POOF! 
Your commit becomes the first and only commit.
Yup, that's right. We're sort of time-travelers here. Or memory erasers. Or both. 🤷

## How does it work? ##
It's all thanks to its fancy GitHub action (and a sprinkle of time dust).
Every time there's a new push:
- Clears out everything, making space for the new.
- Moves all your new stuff in.
- ...and shows it off as the first-ever commit! Ta-da! 🎉
  
## Why would I use this? ##
Maybe you're:
- Nostalgic for the good ol' days when your code was fresh and clean.
- A super-secret agent who needs to keep things on the DL.
- Just feeling playful and want to see the world (or at least your code) from a new perspective.
- Or perhaps you simply want to watch the world burn (or at least your commit history).

## Pushing to this Repository ##
- Add your changes.
- Push to main.
- Grab some popcorn 🍿
- Watch as the history is rewritten!
